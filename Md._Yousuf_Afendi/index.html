<p><h4><h2>Online hospital management system:</h2> A unique cloud based hospital management
system for both patients and hospital stuffs (Doctors, Management). The primary
target of this design is to make hospital experience better than we currently have.
Hospital is a place where no one willingly wants to visit but there are times when
we need to. The old system of hospitals are not very user friendly. The first big
stem is waiting in the queue for long hours. There are lots of other problems that
makes your hospital experience bad. Our main focus is to make peoples life easier
in the hour of need. We are working to design such a system that will reduce a lot
of paperwork and save peoples time.
<h2>Existing software:</h2> You will find hospital management system software in various
hospitals in our country. They have great features to help the hospital but that
does not allow the patients to manage their own data. This is what gave us the
initial motivation to build a system where the system will work for all.
To overcome those limitation we are trying to build a social networking like site
for hospitals that will help everyone working in the hospital and their patients.
Letâ€™s discuss about the system in details and see how it will help us. There are no
such things that comes out without any limitations but we focused to overcome
the best we could do. Our main focus was to determine the features for the
patients. They are the large community of this system and they deserve to get the
most out of this system. There is no doubt that our existing systems does not
provide us the facility to check for our information related to our hospital
documents and other important documents for example prescriptions and test
reports. If this documents are close to us then we can at least be in some peace.
We no longer have to worry about carrying those reports and of course it will help
us the best in terms of losing those precious documents and get into trouble. The
relief will be huge and so will be the benefit. Hopefully this will give us the benefit
that we are expecting.</h4></p>
